Running frontend GUI in your local browser:

Run (from this dir):

npm install
npm start


The GUI should open automatically in your browser.
Make sure you first run the server before starting to use the GUI. 


Upload a series as a zip. Best practice is to zip the image files themselves, rather than a dir 
they contain. The images should be named in lexicographic order corresponding to the sequence. 

Upload can take 1-2 min. Wait for the loading module to finish before continuing.  

A refresh will require you re-"upload" your series (though we automatically cache the
 heavy calculations, so it will take less time)
